# usbrply

Convert a .pcap file (captured USB packets) to Python or C code that replays the captured USB commands.

Supported packet sources are:
* Linux Wireshark (via usbmon)
* Windows Wireshark (via USBPcap)

Supported output formats are:
* libusb Python (primary)
* (libusb C: fixme)
* (Linux Kernel C: fixme)
* JSON

Example applications:
* Rapidly reverse engineer and re-implement USB protocols
* Record a proprietary Windows programming sequence and replay on an embedded Linux device
* Snoop USB-serial packets

# Linux installation

```
# Do one of these
# Easier to setup, but slower
sudo pip install python-pcapng
# Much faster, but no longer maintained
sudo apt-get install -y python-libpcap
git clone https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply.git
cd usbrply
sudo python setup.py install
```

# Windows installation

There is probably an easier way to do this but this is what I got to work. Tested on Windows 7 x64

Setup python and pip
 * Get the latest Python 3 release (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 * I used Python 3.7.8 (Windows x86-64 executable installer)
 * Keep default setup options (in particular this will install pip)

Install libusb1
* pip install libusb1

Install usb drivers
* Some USB drivers won't replay. You need to switch their USB drivers to WinUSB. You can use Zadig to switch between USB libraries for a single device.
* https://zadig.akeo.ie/
* Run Zadig
* Click on **Options** then **List all devices** then select the USB device that doesn't replay properly and **Replace Driver** with WinUSB


Install
* Open a command prompt
  * Default should be your home dir (ex: C:\Users\mcmaster)
* python -m venv usbrply
* usbrply\Scripts\activate.bat
* pip install usbrply

Test
* If not still in venv (prompt like "(usbrply)" ): usbrply/Scripts/activate.bat
* python usbrply\Scripts\usbrply -h
  * You should get a help message
* Download and place in your home dir: https://github.com/JohnDMcMaster/usbrply-test/blob/ca53b765ce3f97c284924a3737fd836f5cfbb7ff/win_misc.pcapng
* python usrply\Scripts\usbrply win1.pcapng
  * You should see python code that will reproduce the .pcap file commands

# Sample workflows

Sample workflow for capturing Windows traffic and replaying traffic in Python:
* Install Wireshark. Make sure you install the USBPcap library
* Start Wireshark
* Connect USB device to computer
* Select which USB device you want to capture by clicking on the tiny blue cogwheel and checking the box next to the USB device you want to capture ![usbPcap](docs/usbPcap.png)
* Double click on the USBPcap to start the capture
* Start your application, do your thing, etc to generate packets
* Close application
* Stop capture
* Save capture. Save in pcap-ng format (either should work)
* Close Wireshark
* Run: "usbrply --wrapper --device-hi -p my.pcapng >replay.py" 
* Linux: run "python replay.py"
* Verify expected device behavior. Did an LED blink? Did you get expected data back?

Sample workflow for capturing Windows VM traffic from Linux host and replaying traffic in Python:
* Example: program a Xilinx dev board under Linux without knowing anything about the JTAG adapter USB protocol
* Linux: Install Wireshark
* Linux: Enable usbmon so Wireshark can capture USB (sudo modprobe usbmon, see http://wiki.wireshark.org/CaptureSetup/USB)
* Linux: Boot Windows VM (ie through VMWare)
* Linux: Start Wireshark. Make sure you have USB permissions (ie you may need to sudo)
* Connect USB device to computer
* Linux: use lsusb to determine which device bus is on. Try to choose a bus (port) with no other devices
* Linux: start catpure on bus from above
* Linux: attach USB device to Windows guest
* Windows: start your application, do your thing, etc to generate packets
* Linux: stop capture
* Linux: save capture. Save in pcap-ng format (either should work)
* Linux: run: "usbrply --device-hi -p my.pcapng >replay.py"
* Linux: detatch USB device from Windows guest
* Linux: run "python replay.py"
* Verify expected device behavior. Did an LED blink? Did you get expected data back?

You may need to filter out USB devices. There are two ways to do this:
* --device-hi: use the last device enumerated. This works well in most cases, including FX2 renumeration
* --device DEVICE: manually specify the USB device used. Get this from lsusb output or Wireshark view

Other useful switches:
* --rel-pkt: intended to easier allow diffing two outputs. Ex: what changed in trace for LED on vs LED off?
* --no-packet-numbers: alternative to above
* --fx2: decode common FX2 commands (ex: CPU reset)
* --range RANGE: only decode a specific packet range. Use along with Wireshark GUI or refine a previous decode
* see --help for more

# JSON output

use -j switch to output a parsing intermediate representation that should resemble original USB requests
along with associated metadata.
This can be used in more advanced applications, such as if you need to decode a complicated protocol
or convert USB output to higher level API calls.
An example can be found here: https://github.com/ProgHQ/bpmicro/blob/master/scrape.py
This example first aggregates USB packets into application specific packets, and then decodes these into API calls


# USB serial decoder

usbrply-serial supported adapters:
  * FT2232C: data rx/tx
